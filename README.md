# Enhancing Extrusion Precision and Reliability in Robotic Multi-Axis Additive Manufacturing through Digital Twin Integration

This repository contains files for the paper titled "Enhancing Extrusion Precision and Reliability in Robotic Multi-Axis Additive Manufacturing through Digital Twin Integration," with Tomáš Jochman as the main author.

This project focuses on improving the precision and reliability of robotic multi-axis additive manufacturing (MAAM) through the innovative integration of a digital twin framework. By developing a comprehensive calibration procedure and optimizing key process parameters—specifically hot-end temperature, layer height, and tool center point (TCP) velocity—the study leverages simulations to achieve precise adjustments and automated code generation for robotic operations. Experimental validations demonstrate that carefully calibrated process parameters can significantly enhance print quality. This work highlights the potential for more accurate and reliable production of complex 3D-printed structures with reduced waste, underscoring the transformative role of digital twins in refining MAAM processes for industrial applications.
